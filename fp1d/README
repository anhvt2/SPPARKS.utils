the package has been developed before but refine at 8Mar18 for further research

before 8Mar18, the back up files are in repo_8Mar18
derivative matrix is calculated from

H. Hassan, A. Mohamad, G. Atteia, An algorithm for the finite difference 
approximation of derivatives with arbitrary degree and order of accuracy,

# research log
# note: expand bounds adaptively if convergence to to the boundary

9Mar18: tried 4 params -> OK performance
11Mar18: tried 6 params -> better calib, but worse afterward
12Mar18: constant diffusion (0th order), high order drift (3th order drift) -> result: heavy tail
13Mar18: tried 2 params, constant diffusion, constant drift -> against the theoretical results
